<header><strong>Top 3 Cities I Would Like To Visit</strong></header>
  <div>Despite being to a couple places in the past 8 years, here are some cities I believe to be my golden opportunities if the situation ever arises or if I take a vacation due to being often talked about or interested in seeing.</div>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Toronto</strong></li>
      <span>A place everyone keeps talking about, especially in the class!</span>
    <li><em>Las Vegas</em></li>
      <span>For the nightlife, explore and be in awe of the lights.</span>
    <li><strong>San Juan</strong></li>
      <span>Was near but never actually visited, heard of so much hype. The life of a Puerto Rican!</span>
